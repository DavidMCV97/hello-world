# Welcome to my Github Tutorial!

**Git** is a Version Control System (VCS), which means is a system to keep track of the modifications you do in a project.
Git is usually used for software projects but it can be used for any project involving computer files.

**Github** is a cloud-based hosting service for git *repositories*.
In other words, Github is where you use Git and saves the files on a cloud.

**Repositories** is the name of Git folders.
Each repository is a project and must contain all the files needed for it.
You can edit and keep track of each repository in many ways.

**Branches** are the key caracteristic of Git repositories.
Branches are parallel workflows on a same project, so are basically versions of the *main repository*.
The main repository is the central version of the project, and other branches are where you can experiment with it.

A **Commit** is an actualization of a repository, it's the way to save changes in files or new files in the repository.
You can add a description of the changes in every commit to keep track of the workflow.
A commit made in a branch will not affect the other branches.

**Pull Request** are the heart of colaboration in github.
A pull request is an invitation to integrate your branch characteristics into another branch.
When you do a pull request, the other branch owner can see the differences between your branch and his branch,
if he decides to accept all changes he must *merge* the changes.If there are any problems in the merge, Git will automatically
declare them *conflicts* and add a space for conflict solution.
